# Carbon-Black-Automation
Various Carbon Black PowerShell functions to help automate routine administration tasks. I plan to refine this and refactor into a proper PS module later.

_**Update 3/12/2021 - the CarbonBlackPS module is now under development, see [CarbonBlackPS](https://github.com/timothymmurphy/CarbonBlackPS)**_

All scripts that can make changes to your environment will ask for user confirmation first.

## Instructions
Simply add your appropriate values to $apiSecret, $apiID, and $environment in each script.
